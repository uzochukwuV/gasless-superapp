now fix this smart contract logic - it builds, now go to make elimination process, here is how winning and elimination is done, eliminaion is for lowest vote, but if 2 options are lowest vote like (A.7 ,B. 5 ,C. 5) thenB and C are eliminated, if 2 options tie in mojority vote, only minority lose, if all tie then revote, if all pick same option just move to next rund, next round questioner will be picked automatically and randomly, !. after revote random questioner is choosen, if everyone picks same option we move it to next round, if players dont answer they get eliminated, game ends in 3 rounds or if between round  1 and 2 only less than 3 players remain
